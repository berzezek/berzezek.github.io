Hello, friends. Here's my new experiment.
This font breaks the boundaries even more. I used SVG technology to achieve maximum realism. The font retains the texture and transparency of the original tool.
And most importantly, this font fully supports Cyrillic! Now you can diversify your projects, create cards and greetings, posts and titles for blogs.
The scope is huge. Plus it's fresh, not like other fonts - the ability to stand out from the crowd

This font completely free for personal use.
